--In this series I am querying data from mulitple tables about customers information and product sales

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(*) orderID 
FROM "JanSales"
WHERE length(orderID = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID');

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(*) product
FROM "JanSales"
WHERE product= "iPhone"; 

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT customers.acctnum
FROM "customers"
INNER JOIN "FebSales"
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(customers.order_id) = 6
AND customers.order_id <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT product, price
FROM "JanSales"
WHERE price= (SELECT MIN(price) FROM "JanSales")
LIMIT 1; 

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity) * price AS product_revenue
FROM "JanSales"
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity)*price AS product_revenue
FROM "FebSales"
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(customers.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM "customers" 
LEFT JOIN "FebSales"
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE FebSales.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
